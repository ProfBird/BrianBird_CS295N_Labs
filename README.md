# BrianBird_CS295N_Labs
This code is from my in-class demos making the web site "All About Pigeons". 
This web site partially follows the group C lab assignments for an informational web site, but instead of a blog, it has a forum for exchanging pigeon information.
These are the branches:
- Lab1: Just an ASP.NET 6.0 MVC web site created from the Visaul Studio 2022 template. The home page has been edited to show the name of the new web site.
- Lab2: Additional pages have been added. Most of these are place-holders for future development.
